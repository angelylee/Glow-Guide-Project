# Project Objective
This was a group project aimed at demonstrating project management and planning skills where we developed a beauty scanner app. The beauty industry is growing vastly which makes it difficult for consumers to decide which products to choose. Many consumers also buy products based on their packaging with little to no information including what ingredients are in it or what kind of concerns it helps with resulting in wasted time and money on products that don't deliver as expected. Also, the cosmetics market is highly competitive, with well-established brands such as L'Oreal, Estee Lauder, Elf, and Dior. These companies have extensive product portfolios and global reach. While there are competitors and existing systems in the cosmetics app, our app “Glow Guide” stands out with a unique blend of features and capabilities:  

<ul>
  <li> Product Description: Offers detailed product information, including ingredient lists and potential allergens, giving users the items they really need. </li>
  <li> Barcode Scanning: Glow Guide provides a barcode scanning feature that allows users to access product details instantly by scanning the product's barcode. This feature eliminates the need for manual searches and provides real-time information. </li>
  <li> Offline Mode: Premium members can scan products even when offline, ensuring uninterrupted access to essential product information, a feature not available in most competitor’s apps.  </li>
  <li> Product Rating & Recommendation: We allow users to rate products based on their ingredients and suitability for various preferences. Users receive unique product recommendations based on their preferences and previous scans. </li>
  <li> Customization: Our app allows users to customize their experience based on their skin and hair preferences, offering filters for vegan, vegetarian, and more, ensuring they find products that align with their values. </li>
